# nesquik
JavaScript-based interpreter to NES 6502 Assembly

Loosely based from emkay's [nesly](https://github.com/emkay/nesly) project.

# Usage
Currently, nesquik is not in a state of active development, and is more of an experiment rather than a legitimate tool. If you do wish to try and use nesquik in some capacity, simply build out your game through the demonstration project included in the github repo. 

There is currently no form of documentation for nesquik at this time, sorry :(

# Potential Fixes / Revamps

- Rethinking fundamental usage/design of nesquik
- Change nesquik's functionality to match something like using SFML or some sort of library in a Javascript project
- Seperate "interpreter/compiler" program that takes pure javascript using nesquik types and functions that can compile to 6502 ASM
